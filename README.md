# Game-Char-Recognition-using-Cifar-10-dataset
## Overview
This project focuses on building a character recognition model for game images using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It showcases the use of CNNs, transfer learning, and visual transformers for deep learning tasks.

## Topics Covered
- Custom CNN architecture for CIFAR-10.
- Transfer learning using VGG16 pre-trained model.
- Implementation of visual transformers for enhanced accuracy.

## Objectives
- Develop a character recognition model with high accuracy.
- Compare performance using various techniques (CNN, transfer learning, transformers).

## Datasets Used
- CIFAR-10: Dataset for character recognition and classification.
